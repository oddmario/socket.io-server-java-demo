# socket.io-server-java-demo
A demo for https://github.com/trinopoty/socket.io-server-java highly inspired by https://github.com/trinopoty/socket.io-server-java/tree/master/socket.io-server-test

This demo project should help you getting started with the basic setup of @trinopoty's Socket.IO Java server as a Jetty embedded servlet.
